            STEPS TO KEEP TRACK
################################################

1) Create index.html []
2) Create product.html []
3) Skip categories and misc stuff for now. Will mainly work on search []
4) Set up setup.sql & dummy.sql with relevant backend information []
5) Set up mapper / search feature (loads the products page) []
6) No product found -> We're just launched. Adding products slowly (popup) | Request quick add []
7) Set up user product request in db (requested_products). No need for frontend there for now []
8) We will then take the product and add those faster than the rest []
9) Allow users to rate a product []
10) rate.html setup (rate a product step-by-step) []
11) Once rated -> return to product.html and display showNotification(product_review_added) []
12) Find a way to limit it to one review per user per product without logging in. []
13) Logged in != -> annon review default profile picture and name []
14) Admin page to upload products via frontend instead of db injections []
15) Find a way to scan product QR codes and trigger the /product to load []
16) If I scan a bag of chips it should trigger the chips page []
17) Store QR code value in DB and have a mapper search QR codes on request []
18) Fix website for IPad & Phone sizes []
19) Beta Release []
